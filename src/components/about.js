                                            <p><strong>Hi I'm Ritesh Goyal</strong></p>
                                            <p>I love coding. Ever since writing my first code in C and see how a small
                                                piece of code ease my task, I have been eager to use software to solve
                                                practical problems. I am passionately engaged in solving a never-ending
                                                puzzle - Software Engineering. I believe in the power of programming to
                                                transform and improve the lives of people around the world.</p>
                                            <p>For my first project, I worked on a desktop application using JFrame. It
                                                inspired me so much into UI that I focused on working in many projects
                                                involving frontend tasks like websites, native applications. Most
                                                recently, I worked on a Dart Application for a competition I
                                                participated in along with my friends. I interned at Samsung Research
                                                Institute Bangalore working on building a deep learning model for a
                                                small feature in the Bixby Voice Assistant. This turned into a full-time
                                                offer and I am ready to extend my role as Software Engineer happily.</p>
                                            <p>I love to manage at various positions that is why I have been Class
                                                Representative of my batch, Chairperson at PEC ACM Student Chapter due
                                                to which I got the opportunity to grow my networking, interpersonal,
                                                organizational and teaching skills. Besides this, I love to travel and
                                                play carrom.</p>
                                            <p>All these pursuits challenge so many aspects of the intellect:
                                                dedication, organization, problem-solving, creativity. This is what
                                                keeps me driving to create beautiful, powerful and useful things and
                                                share them with the world.</p>
